# To-do-app
 This Todo App, built with React and Vite, lets users add, edit, and delete tasks. It uses useState for managing the task list and edit state. An input field handles task entry and updates, with a dynamically enabled add/update button based on input. The component-based design ensures clean code and a user-friendly interface.
